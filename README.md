## References 
Throughout this project, you have likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update as you go.

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `bolloon game.`

**Purpose**: `hit the boolons befeore they touce the ground `

**Source Assignment(s)**: `catnip`

️**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OMhFPZdZ5xJsIJdX41A1JKhcJzJNBqwCuG4Odq0p1k/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crc.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: Karamad
  
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. 🙃

Reflect on what you’ve done so far. How’s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    **i am feeling behind but i feel like i will get most of it done to where it can run and you can play and not just 
    focus on making it look nice. am worred about not finshing i do feel like i will get it all done in time like the day or night 
    before class.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

**Completion Percentage**: `75%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    **i feel like i will finsh most of it but not get to implemnt things that i wanted also put in the project also the
     little things that i could not fix but i have a feeling that i will get 90% of it done
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. ' this game is a ballon game so your goal is to hit as at least 15 ballons as you can before they all drop 
once they all drop if you have less then 15 then you lose if you have more then 15 you win '

### Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
i selected my project because i liked balloons and i wanted to make a game and it i seemed very interesting it was very close
- to my initial design it was not to far off what i learned in this process is how to use pygame and how to implement the pygame 
- during one of the assignments where we used pygame it it was kind of confusing and it was hard for me to understand by game 
- so it real helped with that and it allowed me to really think for my self. the hardest part about this project was to implement my ideas 
- it alwas easy to say what you want to make or build its hard to put it in to practice and code it all. what i would do 
- differantly next time is to not wait to do it and to take my time and actually have a blueprint of what i want to accomplish
